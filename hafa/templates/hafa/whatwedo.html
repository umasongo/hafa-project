	 <h4>Health and Nutrition</h4>
	 <p>The greatest wealth is health1. HAFA considers health2 a basic human right. Better health is central to human happiness and well-being. It also makes an important contribution to economic progress, as healthy populations live longer, are more productive, and save more. Similarly Proper nutrition3 is a powerful good: people who are well nourished are more likely to be healthy, productive and able to learn. On the other hand poor nutrition can lead to reduced immunity, increased susceptibility to disease, impaired physical and mental development, and reduced productivity.</p>

	 <h5>The Challenge</h5>
	 <p><strong>Child health:</strong> Despite substantial progress, the world is still falling short of the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) child mortality target and Sub-Saharan Africa is most affected. The global rate of under-five mortality in 2012 was estimated to be 48 deaths per thousand live births. This is equivalent to the loss of 18,000 children under age five every day which is unacceptable. Sub-Saharan Africa continues to confront a tremendous challenge. Not only does the region have the highest mortality rate in the world for children under age five— more than 16 times the average for developed regions— but it is also the only region where both the number of live births and the under-five population are expected to rise substantially over the next two decades. In 2012, one child in ten in sub-Saharan Africa did not live until their fifth birthday. Nearly half of global under-five deaths in 2012—3.2 million children under age five—occurred in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Maternal health:</strong> Much more still needs to be done to reduce maternal mortality. Globally, the maternal mortality ratio stood at 210 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2013. This still falls far short of the MDG target to reduce the maternal mortality ratio by three quarters by 2015. Despite progress in all world regions, Sub-Saharan Africa had the highest maternal mortality ratio of 510 deaths per 100,000 live births. Most of the maternal deaths in 2013 took place in Sub-Saharan Africa (62 per cent).  Most pregnant women in developing regions see a skilled health provider at least once— only half of them get the recommended four antenatal checkups. In sub-Saharan Africa only 26 per cent n of women of childbearing age (15 -49), were using any method of contraception.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Communicable diseases (HIV, Malaria and TB):</strong> Globally 35.3 million people living with HIV and there are still too many new cases of HIV infection. In 2012 an estimated 2.3 million cases of people were newly infected and 1.6 million deaths from AIDS-related causes. Sub-Saharan Africa was the region where 70 per cent new infections occurred. In sub-Saharan Africa, the region most affected by the HIV epidemic, only 39 per cent of young men and 28 per cent of young women aged between 15 and 24 had comprehensive knowledge of HIV. In the same region, condom use among young men and young women who had higher-risk sex reached 57 per cent and 37 per cent, respectively. These rates were far below the 95 per cent target agreed at the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on HIV and AIDS in 2001. The world is on track to achieving the malaria target, but great challenges remain. An estimated 3.4 billion people are still at risk of malaria infection. In 2012, about 207 million cases of malaria occurred around the world, and the disease killed about 627,000 people, 80 per cent of them children under age five. Only an estimated 36 per cent of the populations living in malaria-risk areas in sub-Saharan Africa were sleeping under an ITN in 2013. Pregnant women and children continue to be the ones most at risk for illness and deaths from malaria.  The rate of decline in the incidence of tuberculosis has been very slow. Well over 2 billion people are estimated to have been infected by mycobacterium tuberculosis in their past. In 2012, an estimated 1.3 million people died from the disease, of whom 320,000 were HIV-positive.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Malnutrition:</strong> A total of 842 million people, or about one in eight people in the world, were estimated to be suffering from chronic hunger in 2011–2013. The vast majority of those people (827 million) resided in developing regions. Despite overall progress, marked differences in reducing undernourishment have persisted across regions. In comparison, sub-Saharan Africa has shown limited progress in recent years, remaining the region with the highest prevalence of undernourishment. An estimated 99 million children under age five in the world were underweight—inadequate weight for age— in 2012. This represented 15 per cent of all children under five, or approximately one in seven. Sub-Saharan Africa, despite a modest reduction in the prevalence of underweight children since 1990, was the only region where the number of undernourished children increased, from an estimated 27 million to 32 million, between 1990 and 2012. Meanwhile despite steady gains, one in four children around the world remains stunted. Again all regions have experienced a decline in the number of children affected by stunting, except sub-Saharan Africa, where the number of stunted children increased alarmingly by one third, from 44 million to 58 million between 1990 and 2012.</p>
    
    <p>Every year; malnutrition is implicated in about 40% of the 11 million deaths of children under five in developing countries, and lack of <a href="http://www.childinfo.org/eddb/brfeed/countries.htm">immediate and exclusive breastfeeding</a> in infancy causes an additional 1.5 million of these deaths. However, contrary to popular belief, only a fraction of these children die from starvation in catastrophic circumstances such as famine or war. In the majority of cases, the lethal hand of malnutrition and poor breastfeeding practices is far more subtle: they cripple children’s growth, render them susceptible to disease, dull their intellects, diminish their motivation, and sap their productivity. </p>
    
    <h5>HAFA’s Interventions </h5>
    <p>AFA is addressing these challenges through a multiple of integrated intervention as presented below.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Maternal and Child Health:</strong> Most maternal and child deaths are preventable. HAFA supports well-known health-care solutions for the prevention and handling of complications. We promote concerted effort to ensure universal access to both skilled antenatal care and effective interventions, enhanced to include access to family planning, and information and services for reproductive health, especially in vulnerable populations. Through the implementation of integrated management of childhood illnesses, HAFA supports a holistic approach to disease management where the overall health of the child is considered, addressing all causes of childhood illness. This approach focuses on treatment, prevention, care home management of the sick child and promote proper immunization of infants. </p>
    
    <p><strong>Communicable diseases (HIV, Malaria and TB):</strong> Building capacity and scaling up resources in response to the most prevalent diseases on the continent – tuberculosis, malaria and HIV, including preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV – continue to be a key focus of HAFA’s work in disease prevention and treatment. Strengthening laboratory services to provide better diagnostics for malaria and tuberculosis and greater access to HIV screening will go a long way in prevention and treatment of infectious diseases. HAFA incorporates a holistic approach to managing disease, as any treatment must be accompanied by education programmes to prevent the spread of disease, measures to ensure that patients follow treatment plans and adequate health staff to diagnose disease and administer and monitor treatment, particularly in remote areas.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Malnutrition:</strong> We work towards improving maternal nutrition, especially before, during and immediately after pregnancy; early and exclusive breastfeeding; and timely, safe, appropriate and high-quality complementary food for infants, accompanied by appropriate micronutrient interventions.</p>
    
    <h4>Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH)</h4>
    <p>Water is life. Without access to safe water, it is impossible to prevent disease and maintain good health. Water also plays a significant role in economic development of the community. If a woman spends most of the day walking many kilometres to fetch safe drinking water, she has little time for income generating activities or proper care of her family. <strong>“Safe drinking water and adequate sanitation are crucial for poverty reduction, crucial for sustainable development, and crucial for achieving any and every one of the Millennium Development Goals” – UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon.</strong></p>
    
    <h5>The Challenge </h5>
    <p>In 2003, the United Nations declared the decade from 2005 – 2015 the ‘Water for Life’ International Decade for Action, primarily to promote efforts to fulfil commitments to meeting the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target for water and sanitation: halve, by 2015, the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation. According to the latest estimates of the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP), released in early 2013, 36 per cent of the world’s population – 2.5 billion people – lack improved sanitation facilities, and 768 million people still use unsafe drinking water sources. Inadequate access to safe water and sanitation services, coupled with poor hygiene practices, kills and sickens thousands of children every day. Water is not easily accessible to many households, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Many people, usually women or young girls, often need to join long queues or walk long distances to get to an improved water source.</p>
    <p>Poor sanitation, water and hygiene have many other serious repercussions. Children – and particularly girls – are denied their right to education because their schools lack private and decent sanitation facilities. Women are forced to spend large parts of their day fetching water. Without WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene), sustainable development is impossible.</p>
    
    <h5>HAFA’s Interventions</h5>
    <p><strong>Water Supply:</strong> HAFA supports water supply for multiple uses (drinking and other economic uses) with appropriate technology. For drinking water supply we also address issues for   water quality surveillance to ensure that the water we provide meets quality standards.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Sustainable Operation and maintenance:</strong> In many of HAFA’s operational countries the issue of non-functional water sources is a perpetual problem. With targeted programming in areas such as spare parts supply, effective water management committees, facilitating public sector reforms and supporting private sector including hand pump mechanic associations, HAFA hopes to provide more sustainable water supply projects and contribute to key learning on this subject.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Sanitation promotion:</strong> HAFA supports a renowned Community Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) for promoting basic sanitation in communities especially in rural settings. CLTS is powerful in triggering the behavior of the communities to demand for basic sanitation which is a crucial starting point for the process of achieving open defecation free (ODF) communities that have generally adopted improved sanitary behavioral practices. In enabling communities to continually climb the sanitation ladder; HAFA uses Sanitation Marketing (SanMark) approach to address demand and supply for sanitation products/services.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Effective Hygiene promotion:</strong> HAFA applies Social and Behavior change communication (SBCC) approach; hygiene promotion messages/materials are strategic tools for triggering and achieving positive health outcomes, based on proven theories and models of behavior change. It enables the target groups to adapt and maintain appropriate hygienic behaviours for healthful living.  SBCC employs a systematic process beginning with formative research and behavior analysis, followed by communication planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. Audiences are carefully segmented, messages and materials are pre-tested, and both mass media and interpersonal channels are used to achieve defined behavioral objectives.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Institutional WASH:</strong> HAFA supports institutions1 with both hardware and software interventions like construction of Ventilated Improved Pit (VIP) Latrines, Rainwater Harvesting Tanks and supporting School health clubs through Children’s Hygiene and Sanitation Training (CHAST). We also integrate the use of Effective Microorganisms (EM) technology for reducing foul smell and sludge in institutional latrines especially in schools.</p>
    
    <h4>Livelihoods and Markets</h4>
    <p>Livelihood comprises the capabilities, assets (including both material and social resources) and activities required for a means of living (Carney, 1998). Markets refer to the place or arrangements for the exchange of goods and services. A value chain is a set of value-adding activities through which a product passes from the initial production or design stage to final delivery to the consumer (Kaplinsky, 2000) and can be local, national, regional or international in scope. <strong>Livelihoods and markets</strong> development is a vast field with a number of approaches and actors operating simultaneously. There are different pro-poor approaches ranging from creating a more conducive and enabling environment, to an emphasis on trade and market access, micro-enterprise development, and the application of various financial instruments.</p>
    
    <h5>The Challenge</h5>
    <p>The major problem affecting value chain projects in Africa is that input suppliers such as seed, insecticide, fertilizer, equipment etc are based in urban areas several kilometers away from smallholder farmers. This forces farmers to use conventional means in agriculture. Globalization has also had a significant impact on smallholder famers. In many ways globalization is good, but it is killing smallholder farmers in Africa because they are forced to compete with big international farmers. These corporate farms have access to credits from banks, use sophisticated equipment, etc. The local farmers are failing to meet the same quality standards as that achieved by big international farmers.</p>
    <p>One way value chain interventions can address this problem is by nurturing collectives so that, as a group, they can produce high-quality outputs. Value chain projects can also minimize the impact of international competition by ensuring quality production in all the processes of value chain through good and timely access to agriculture inputs including good transportation systems, advanced agriculture systems, usage of new post-harvest technologies, and collective marketing. It is also important that collectives have the ability to write local project proposals to government and nongovernmental organization to access financial support for running interventions.</p>
    
    <h5>HAFA’s Interventions</h5>
    <p><strong>Improve food and income security:</strong> HAFA is working to help disadvantaged people access quality training and technical support, as well as to encourage innovation and enterprise We also with partner organisations to ensure that poor and marginalised people are able to access and protect the land and natural resources on which they depend for their living, as well as raising community awareness of policy and planning that affects them and their rights. Where traditional options for making a living are no longer viable because of changes in environment or climate we explore alternative or diversified income. Our aim is to build national and community resilience to environmental shocks.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Increase markets access for the poor:</strong> HAFA supports people’s participation in local and global value chains, whether as producers, suppliers, employees or entrepreneurs. We achieve this by offering market-driven vocational skills training, mentorship, networking, and by helping small and medium sized businesses to grow their capacity and yields. We work with local people to identify new markets for produce and ways of growing incomes. For example, negotiation skills training with partners in Kenya enabled local farmers to get a better, fairer price for their groundnut produce.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Private sector partnerships:</strong> For work securing sustainable food and income sources, harnessing the expertise and resources of the private sector is particularly valuable. We share interest with our corporate partners in increasing the benefits of market activity for local communities (particularly women and youth). </p>
